  abstract  = {We empirically examine the price impact of order book events in the NASDAQ exchange using the INET System. We show that the order flow imbalance, defined as the imbalance between supply and demand at the best bid and ask prices, is a key variable in explaining short-term price movements. We develop a vector autoregressive model for price changes, order flow imbalance, and market depth, and show that order flow imbalance explains a significant proportion of the variance of price changes at short time scales.},
